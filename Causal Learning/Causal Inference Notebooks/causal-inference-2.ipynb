There is still a lot that I haven't had a change to cover. Very loosely, work with them can be categorised in two area:\n","\n"," - **Identification**: Given assumptions about the causal structure of a system, can we estimate influence of one variable on another.\n"," - **Discovery**: Given data, how can we estimate the causal structure of a system.\n"," \n","The backdoor adjustment method is one example of identification discussed in these notes - it is not the only one. In my [next post](http://www.degeneratestate.org/posts/2018/Sep/03/causal-inference-with-python-part-3-frontdoor-adjustment/) I will look at how we can use mediating variables to make causal inferences. More generally, [it has been shown](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-191.pdf) that for partly observed causal graphical models it is possible to decide exactly whether or not a causal statement is identifiable and the rules of do-calculus are complete. \n","\n","In the other direction, learning causal structure is much more difficult. There are [some tools](http://www.phil.cmu.edu/tetrad/) out there to estimate structure, but in my experience, when guided only by the data they tend to produce nonsensical results. I suspect this is because given only limited observational data there often is not enough information to accurately estimate structure. There is some [interested work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01332) on how to use combinations of observational data from different setting to try and infer structure, but I think in general this is an open problem.\n","\n","I hope to have a chance to discuss more of these areas in future posts."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"8M0NA4AJ8uNZ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Code\n","\n","You can find the notebook for this post on github [here](https://github.com/ijmbarr/notes-on-causal-inference)."]}]}
