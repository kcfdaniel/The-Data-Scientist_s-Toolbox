\begin{frame}{Traditional Approaches}

John Stuart Mill's \textbf{Method of Difference}:\medskip

\begin{quote}
If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs, and
an instance in which it does not occur, have every circumstance in
common save one, that one occurring only in the former; the circumstance
in which alone the two instances differ is the effect, or the cause, or
an indispensable part of the cause, of the phenomenon.
\end{quote}\medskip

% idea to compare like and like are often invoked in CP 

% that are alike in every way except one: they differ in the presence or absence of the
% antecedent we conjecture to be the true cause of a.

% For these methods to lead to valid inferences, though, there
% must be only one possible cause of the effect of interest, the
% relationship between cause and effect must be deterministic,
% and there must be no measurement error.

\pause

It would be fantastic if two cases were exactly alike and only differ in one single characteristic, but we rarely have such comparisons in the social sciences 


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{More from Mill}

\small
%thatMill himself railed against the exact use to which his methods have been put.

\begin{quote}

If so little can be done by the method to determine conditions of an effect of many combined causes in the case of the medical sciences, still less is the method applicable to a class of phenomena more complicated than even those of physiology, the phenomena of politics and history. There, Plurality of Causes exists in almost boundless excess, and effects are, for the most part, inextricably interwoven with one another. To add to the embarrassment, most of the inquiries in political science relate to the production of effects of a most comprehensive description, such as the public wealth, the public security, public morality, and the like: results liable to be affected directly or indirectly either in plus or minus by nearly every fact which exists, or event which occurs, in human society. \alert{The vulgar notion that, the safe methods on political subjects are those of Baconian induction [...] will one day be quoted as among the most unequivocal marks of a low state of the speculative faculties in any age in which it is accredited.} 
\end{quote}

%\pause
%
%\begin{quote}
%For even if we could try to experiments upon a nation or upon the human race, with little scruple as M. Magendie tried them on dogs and rabbits, we should never succeed on making two instances identical in every respect except the presence of absence of some one definite circumstance. 
%\end{quote}

%\begin{quote}
%Nothing can be more ludicrous than the sort of parodies on experimental
%reasoning which one is accustomed to meet with, not in popular
%discussion only, but in grave treatises, when the affairs of nations are
%the theme.
%\end{quote}
%
%\pause
%
%\begin{quote}
%How, it is asked, can an institution be bad, when the country has
%prospered under it? How can such or such causes have contributed to the
%prosperity of one country, when another has prospered without them?
%Whoever makes use of an argument of this kind, not intending to deceive,
%should be sent back to learn the elements of some one of the more
%\textbf{easy} physical sciences.

There are many econometric specifications in which measures of economic

who do not take estrogen\ldots{}the evidence clearly supports a
